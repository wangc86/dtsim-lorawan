A simple discrete-time simulator for cyber-physical systems research in LoRaWAN, originally written for the validation of the idea proposed in the following research paper:

Chao Wang, Cheng-Hsun Chuang, Yu-Wei Chen, and Yun-Fan Chen. 2024. On Cyber-Physical Fault Resilience in Data Communication: A Case From A LoRaWAN Network Systems Design. ACM Trans. Cyber-Phys. Syst. 8, 3, Article 36 (July 2024), 25 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3639571

Now, it is undergoing some updates for a new, related research project.
